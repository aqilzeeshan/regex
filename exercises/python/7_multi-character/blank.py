# Write your regular expressions inside the raw string.
#      for example: r'a+'
# Add flags in a (?) string at the beginning of the regex.
#      for example r'(?m)a+'
#
# IMPORTANT NOTE: in python, the 'g' flag does not exist, and instead
# the notion of one match vs all matches is designated by
# which method you use. If a g flag is required, you may omit it;
# I will take care of the proper method in the tests. We will
# talk about methods in the python-specific section at the
# end of the course.

# Exercise 29: Match strings that contain either `puppy` or
# `puppies` (no quotes, case sensitive)

# Exercise 30: Match a string whose only contents represent
# a playing card. This would be the card number, which is
# - a choice of 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, J, Q, K, A
# - a space character
# - the word `of` (without the quotes)
# - a space character
# - the suit (hearts, spades, diamonds, or clubs)

# Exercise 31: Test whether a string is a valid hex web color:
# The string must start with a `#` (no quotes)
# then contain 3 or 6 (but not 4 or 5) hex digits
#
# alphabetical hex digits can be lower or uppercase
# The hex string should comprise the entire string.

# Exercise 32: In a log file, parse out all lines that contain
# `ERROR` or `FATAL` (no quotes). 
# Example log contents:
