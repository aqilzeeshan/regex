# Exercise 2: Match the word “hi” (without quotes), followed by two
# or more s’s, in the most readable form you can.

# Exercise 3: Match the word “Yay” (without quotes)with three, four,
# five or six exclamation points at the end

# Exercise 4: Match “Call me maybe” (without quotes) with any number of ?s
