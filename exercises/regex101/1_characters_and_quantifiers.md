# Regex 101 Exercises for Explicit Characters and Quantifiers

These exercises are in text form, with Exercise strings and expected outcomes to check against in Regex101.

_Note:Â We haven't yet learned how to enforce that the entire string should match, so some of the "wrong" strings will have partial matches. If this is the case, I've indicated that the regular expression "should not match the entire string."_
