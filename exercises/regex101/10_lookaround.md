These exercises are in text form, with exercise strings and expected outcomes to check against in Regex101.

### ðŸ‘‰ Exercise 42

Given a file with command-line capture, find all the commands.

- The prompt looks like this:
  - `directoryname git:(branchname) $`, where `directoryname` and `branchname` are the working directory and git branch, respectively.
- The regular expression should capture only commands, not output (which would occur on lines that did not start with a prompt), and not the prompts themselves.

  - ```
    udemy-regex git:(master) $ cd exercises
    exercises git:(master) $ ls
    js     python
    exercises git:(master) $ cd python
    python git:(master) $ ls

    python git:(master) $ cd 9_lookaround
    9_lookaround git:(master) $ ls
    __pycache__ evaluate.py
    9_lookaround git:(master) $ touch lookaround.py

### ðŸ‘‰ Exercise 45

- ```
  He was bald, or mostly bald â€“ a crop of white stubble gilded his ears â€“ and gave off an air of pent-up energy, of emotions kept in check; the same sense Lamb had had watching the video of him, shot eighteen years ago, through a two-way mirror in one of Regentâ€™s Parkâ€™s luxury suites. Joke. These were underground, and were where the Serviceâ€™s more serious debriefings took place; those which it might later prove politic to deny had happened.
  ```
  should return
  - `check`
  - `place`
- ```
  Mabel the Cat had made a big pot of goulash; it was simmering on the stove.

  Goulash was Harry the Dog's favorite; the scent drew him to the kitchen.

  As Mabel]'s culinary efforts continued, with bread baking in the oven and a cabbage dish just begun, she admonished Harry to keep out of her way; but Harry's ability to remain at a decent distance from the stove was severely challenged.

  Mabel did not take kindly to the encroachment of Harry into her personal cooking space; indeed, she at one point responded to the sudden appearance of his muzzle at her elbow with a distinct and species-appropriate hiss.

  Harry was an animal driven by primal need to gain immediate access to the goulash; his options for achieving that aim were, however, limited.

  Mabel's cooking prowess, honed through years of complex feasts, was formidable; the interruption of its application ill-advised.

  The scent of the baking bread was sublime, the perfume of the goulash intoxicating.

  On one important point Harry and Mabel agreed; that is, it would be better for all if Harry found somewhere else to be while Mabel finished cooking.
  ```

  should return

  - `goulash`
  - `favorite`
  - `way`
  - `space`
  - `goulash`
  - `formidable`
  - `agreed`

### ðŸ‘‰ Exercise 46

Given a list of file names, capture files that contain `py` but not at the end of the string (that is, not python files). Hint: use negative lookbehind from the end of the string.

- ```
  happy.js
  happy.py
  sad.sh
  sad.py
  pyrite.go
  ```
  should return
  - `happy.js`
  - `pyrite.go`
