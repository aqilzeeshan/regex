######## LECTURE EXAMPLE 34 - 36 ########
#  Unfortunately, capture groups are not supported by grep. 
#
#  Only built-in grep is covered in this course, but you can 
#     access capture groups with awk (built-in to *nix systems) or 
#     pcre2grep (which you can download from http://www.pcre.org/
#     and compile).
